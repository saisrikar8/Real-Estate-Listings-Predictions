# Real-Estate-Listings-Predictions

This program allows you to find the average market value of a house based on the city it is in and the floor plan size in square feet. It uses web-scraping to get its data from MLS listings. In addition, this program implements the gradient descent algorithm to create a linear regression model.

If you want to find the linear regression modeling code, it is in the `SmartGraph2D` class in `Graph.py`.
